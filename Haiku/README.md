# Haiku Documentation

My first step was to open the CLI and navigate using the CD command to the Haiku folder. I also used LS to make sure I knew where I was. 

I confirmed that I was in the right place using the "pwd" command

I then ran the following command
`say "Here is my haiku, I'm trying my best right now, I don't want to fail" -o haiku.aiff`
in order to save my haiku as an aiff file to the folder.

I then listened back to the file to make sure that it saved properly
